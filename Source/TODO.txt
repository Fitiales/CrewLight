* Transfer the settings to the stock settings in-game screen

* When a part is removed from the ship try to access it and remove it from closeVesselLightModule instead
	of rebuilding the entire list, only rebuild the list for staging event
	
* When AGX not installed add a right click menu button to add/remove light from the Light action group
